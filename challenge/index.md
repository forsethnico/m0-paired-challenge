Nicole was the driver and Maia was the navigator. We got stuck initially by missing the first step of creating a javascript file but then we realized as we were writing javascript in our markdown file that we missed a step. So we went back and created the javascript file. That sidelined our time a bit. We also struggled a little on the fork/clone workflow, but we worked through it and referred back to some previous notes. I think we worked together well and we were making good progress by the end.
